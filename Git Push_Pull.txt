These commands work for me:

1. Make sure to pull the most recent version of the project from Github
- git pull origin 
(if "origin" does not exist create an origin by:)
- git remote add origin (url)
2. Add file/s that you want to push.
- git add "name of file/s"
- using the "." (dot) to add all the files is not recommended, to avoid setbacks.
3. Commit files
- git commit -m "some meaning full message of what you updated"
4. Push Files 
- git push origin
(once again: (if "origin" does not exist create an origin by: git remote add origin (url))

use "git status" at any point to check status of files.
